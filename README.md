# Anabatos-Clone
## A clone of my team's app for mobile application programming.

I was personally responsible for the android side of the Contacts fragments and the web service components of Contacts, Login, Signup, Verification, Password Change, and Account Recovery. Additionally did the apidoc for all of the aformentioned sets of endpoints and the javadoc comments for the contacts fragments. Because this is a clone, the original project board containing our user stories is not included as well as all of the branches and pull requests. All of the code for the final version is included as well as the APK for the project. [The API doc is here.](http://team-5-tcss-450.herokuapp.com/doc/) [The project description is in this file.](https://github.com/IJones52/Anabatos-Clone/files/6683105/TCSS450.Project.Description.2021sp.pdf)
