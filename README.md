# Anabatos-Clone
## A clone of my team's app for mobile application programming.

I was personally responsible for the android side of the Contacts fragments and the web service components of Contacts, Login, Signup, Verification, Password Change, Account Recovery. Additionally did the apidoc for all of the aformentioned sets of endpoints and the javadoc comments for the contacts fragments. Because this is a clone, the original project board containing our user stories is not included.[The project description is in this file.](https://github.com/IJones52/Anabatos-Clone/files/6683105/TCSS450.Project.Description.2021sp.pdf)
